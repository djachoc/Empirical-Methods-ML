    "\n",
    "In a $k$-dimensional space, a [hyperplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane) is a flat affine subspace of dimension $k-1$. For instance, in two dimensions, a hyperplane is a flat one-dimensional subspace - in other words, a line. In three dimensions, a hyperplane is a flat two-dimensional subspace - that is, a plane. In $k>3$ dimensions, it can be hard to visualize a hyperplane, but the notion of a $(k-1)$ -dimensional flat subspace still applies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical definition of a hyperplane is quite simple. In two dimensions, a hyperplane is defined by the equation\n",

    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",

    "for parameters $\\beta_{0}, \\beta_{1}$, and $\\beta_{2}$. When we say that the above equation \"defines\" the hyperplane, we mean that any $X=\\left(X_{1}, X_{2}\\right)^{\\prime}$ for which the equation holds is a point on the hyperplane. Note this equation is simply the equation of a line, since indeed in two dimensions a hyperplane is a line."
