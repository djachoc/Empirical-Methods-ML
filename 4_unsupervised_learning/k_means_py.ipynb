Since the resulting classification will depend on the initial (random) cluster assignment in Step 1, the algorithm is said to find a _local_ rather than a _global_ optimum. Therefore it is important to run the algorithm multiple times from different random initial configurations, e.g., between 25 to 50 times is recommended.
