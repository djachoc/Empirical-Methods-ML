As before the sum of squared error contour sets are the ellipses with the least squares solution at the center. The constraint set is the shaded polytope. The LASSO estimator is the intersection point between the constraint set and the largest ellipse drawn, and in this example hits a vertex of the constraint set, and so the constrained estimator sets $\\widehat{\\beta}_1=0$.
